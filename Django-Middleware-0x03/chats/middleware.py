# --- Logging Configuration ---
# This section configures the basic logging setup for the middleware.
# It's important to note that `basicConfig` should ideally be called
# only once when the application starts, typically in a settings file
# or an application initialization script, to avoid re-configuring
# the logger with every module import or middleware instantiation.

logging.basicConfig(
    filename="requests.log",  # Specifies the file where log messages will be written.
    # This file will be created in the current working directory
    # if it doesn't already exist.
    level=logging.INFO,  # Sets the logging threshold to INFO. This means only messages
    # with severity INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL will be
    # processed and written to the log file. DEBUG messages will be ignored.
    format="%(message)s",  # Defines the format string for log messages.
    # "%(message)s" means that only the actual log message,
    # passed to logging.info(), will be recorded, without
    # extra information like timestamp, logger name, or level,
    # as these are being manually added in the log message itself.

# --- RequestLoggingMiddleware Class Definition ---
# This class defines a middleware component that can be integrated into
# web frameworks supporting the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard,
# such as Django, Flask (with appropriate wrappers), etc.
# Middleware functions as a 'hook' that processes requests before they
# reach the view and responses before they are sent back to the client.


class RequestLoggingMiddleware:
    """
    A simple middleware to log incoming HTTP requests.

    This middleware captures details about each request, including the timestamp,
    the user making the request (distinguishing between authenticated and
    anonymous users), and the requested URL path. It writes these details
    to a configured log file.
    """

        """
        Initializes the RequestLoggingMiddleware.

        This constructor is called once when the web server starts and loads
        the middleware. It receives a callable that represents the next
        middleware in the chain or the final view function.

        Args:
            get_response (callable): The next middleware or the view function
                                     to be called after this middleware has

        This method is called for every incoming request. It performs the

        # authentication middleware) and that the user object has an 'is_authenticated' property.
